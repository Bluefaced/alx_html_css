In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page using all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.
This project does not come with a lot of instructions and you are free to implement it the way you want.
The objective is to have a fully functional web page that looks the same as your reference designer file.
To get started, create a Figma account if you don't have already. 
Select a design file from Figma that you want your website to look like.
If it is a shared file, make sure you "duplicate a copy" in order to access all design details. 
If your computer doesnâ€™t have missing fonts, you can find them here: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro and https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT
Some values are in float, feel free to round them.
The web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less, links hover/active: #FF6565, button hover/active: opacity: 0.9, and max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page.
If you face any challenges while undertaking this project, first check google.com for a better understanding of the topic, run your code through WC3 validator or check alx on Youtube for a similarly solved project.
