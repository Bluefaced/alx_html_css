Use the starter HTML and CSS files from this task to task 7.

Copy the contents of the starter files into the files (0-index.html and 0-styles.css for this task) that you need to produce and make the necessary changes according to the task description.

NB: For each task add the external css file to the HTML. For example, add <link rel='stylesheet' href='0-styles.css'> to the head element in 0-index.html

When using display: flex; on a container, all direct children become flex-items (and no more inline or block elements).

With display flex, margins are not collapsing as they would with block items. Also remember that flexbox is 1-dimensional system (vs CSS Grid which is a 2 dimensional system)
