<p> Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty (born December 8, 1982), known professionally as Nicki Minaj (/ˈnɪki mɪˈnɑːʒ/), is a Trinidadian-born[a] rapper, singer, and songwriter based in the United States. Often referred to as the "Queen of Rap", she is known for her musical versatility, animated flow in her rapping, alter egos, and influence in popular music. She first gained recognition after releasing three mixtapes between 2007 and 2009.</p>
<p> Minaj is one of the best-selling music artists, with more than 100 million records sold worldwide.[7] Billboard ranked her as the top selling female rapper of the 2010s and one of the greatest rappers of all time.[8][9] She has twenty-three top 10 singles in the US, the most for any female rapper, with six of those being solo songs. Her various accolades include eight American Music Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards (including the 2022 Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award), twelve BET Awards, four Billboard Music Awards, a Brit Award, three Guinness World Records and twelve Grammy nominations. Outside of music, her film and television career has included voice roles in the animated films Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012) and The Angry Birds Movie 2 (2019), supporting roles in the films The Other Woman (2014) and Barbershop: The Next Cut (2016) and being an American Idol judge. In 2016, Time included her on their annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Throughout her career, Minaj's outspoken views, social media disputes and her fanbase have received significant media coverage.</p>
<p> <strong> Pink Friday</strong> was released on November 19, 2010, debuting at number two and later reaching number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 375,000 copies.[63][64] It had the highest sales week for a female rap album this century and second highest sales week overall after Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998). Upon release, the album received generally positive reviews from critics.[65] The album was certified platinum in December, with it becoming the first album by a solo female rapper to go platinum in seven years.[66][67] "Moment 4 Life" featuring Drake was released as the fourth single from Pink Friday shortly after the album's release.[68] The song served as the third single off the album, released as a single on December 7, 2010. Minaj performed "Right Thru Me" and "Moment 4 Life" as the musical guest on the January 29, 2011, episode of Saturday Night Live. </p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, after a social media hiatus, Minaj announced a song collaboration with rapper Lil Baby called "Do We Have a Problem?".[242] The track was released in February, along with a music video that featured guest appearances from actors Joseph Sikora and Cory Hardrict.[243][244] The video contained a snippet of another Lil Baby collaboration titled "Bussin", which was released a week later, on February 11.[245][246][247] "Do We Have a Problem?" debuted and peaked at number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. It became Minaj's twentieth top ten entry in the U.S, extending her record as the female rapper with the most U.S. top ten singles. In a promotional Apple Music interview with DJ Zane Lowe, Minaj said her forthcoming fifth studio album is "coming very soon".[248] She described it as "fun, gutta, and back to the basics".[249] Her other ventures also include fronting the campaign for the "Heaven" Spring 2022 collection by Marc Jacobs, which launched in March.</p>
