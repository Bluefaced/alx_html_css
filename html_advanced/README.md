In this project, you will implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file (figma)
For your first project, you will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.
This project is a great way to put into practice concepts learnt about html. Since a design template has been provided, it is easy to visualise the final outcome of the project.
To get started, create a Figma account if you don't have already. 
Select a design file from Figma that you want your website to look like.
If it is a shared file, make sure you "duplicate a copy" in order to access all design details. 
If your computer doesnâ€™t have missing fonts, you can find them here: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro and https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT
Some values are in float, feel free to round them.
If you face any challenges while undertaking this project, first check google.com for a better understanding of the topic, run your code through WC3 validator or check alx on Youtube for a similarly solved project.
This project is maintained by me, Janet Awuku and I am the only contributor to the project. You can reach out to me via linkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/janet-awuku/ if you have any challenges.
